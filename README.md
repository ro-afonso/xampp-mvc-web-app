# Web App with XAMPP and MVC
Development of a small Web App using XAMPP (Cross-platform, Apache, MySQL, PHP, Perl) and an MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework.

The Web App allows CRUD operations for users and products, as demonstrated in the video below:

# How to run

Follow these steps to perform the operations demonstrated in the video:
1) Install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
2) Open Xampp and start MySQL
3) Open the console and run "mysql -u root -h localhost â€“p"
4) Set user and password by running "ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'sim'"
5) Run the "migration.bat" script to migrate schemas and data
6) Run "php -S localhost:80" on the console to invoke all routes
7) The Web App is now available at "http://localhost/app.php?service=showLayout"
8) Perform the desired CRUD operations for users and products
